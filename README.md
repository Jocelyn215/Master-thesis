The goal of this thesis project is to release traffic scenario classification models to identify traffic scenarios from driving data. 

Part of my codes are presented. 1-4 are the code files for data annotation and extracting scenarios using MATLAB. 5-12 are the code files for feature selection and implementing models. Public data which are used in this project includes DataFrontTargets.csv, DataLane.csv and DataWsu.csv from the link below.
